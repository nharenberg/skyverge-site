  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>Hello World! My name is Nicholas Harenberg, now let me tell you why I am the perfect fit for this position ðŸ‘Œ .
     First I'll address the requirements for this job: <br>
      I have a very very solid understanding of HTML and CSS as well as JavaScript and some JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, NodeJS, and others.
      I am also teaching myself ReactJS.  <br>
      I was born in New York and was raised in Denver, Colorado, meaning I have Native-level fluency in English.
      I also find myslef to be very articulate and very well written. <br>
      Curiosity is, to me, a very crucial attribute to have in the world of web development. Coding languages are contantly coming out with new libraries and frameworks that require new syntaxs and if you struggle to keep up, you may find yourslef falling behind.
      As I mentioned, I am teaching myself ReactJS because it is quickly becoming a household name in Silicon Valley and I have a strong desire to get a strong grasp on it. <br>
      Working in a remote environment has never been a problem for me, I have made websites for small businesses in New York all in a remote location. <br>
      1-2 work trips a year sounds like an awesome time. I love traveling and would love to do more of it!
  </p>

      <h5>Telling a Customer "No"</h5>
      <p>The first instance that comes to mind of when I had to tell a customer "No" or fix their mistake is when i was building a real-estate website for an agent in New York and he was trying to implement an RSS feed into his site.
      This man truly had no idea what he was doing when it came to HTML/CSS and he asked me to fix his code so the feed would work.
      I was put in a position where I believed it would've been easier to nuke his code and start from scratch, so I explained that to him and went about building it myself without upsetting him or insulting his abilities.
      </p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <h5>Is the Customer Always Right?</h5>
      <p>As someone who worked in both retail and restaurant as a young adult while getting my eduaction, I know for a fact that the customer is not always right, in my expierence there are two solutions that work best in correcting them: <br>
      â€¢ Number one is being friendly and apologetic as hell and explaining to them how they're wrong. <br>
      â€¢ Numer two is giving them the all the information they need to figure out their question themselves.
      </p>

    <h5>Favorite GIF and Emoji</h5>
    <img src="http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/michael-scott-checks-toby.gif" alt=""><br>
    <caption>I'm a huge hockey fan, I've played it my whole life, and I also love The Office and Steve Carell.</caption>
    <h1>ðŸ‘½</h1>
    <p>That's my favorite emoji, because "<i>If the Universe is infinite, there are infinite possibilities</i>" - Tom DeLonge

    <h2>A Day in the Life</h2>

    <h5>Pre-Sales</h5>
    <p>In this situation, I would explain to them that my app does not currently have the feature they asked about, but that it does have many other features that the app they're thinking about using might not.</p>
    <hr>
    <h5>Fire Alarm</h5>
    <p>The first thing I would do on this day would be go through a few of the emails to see if there was a common theme in everyones concerns and find the best way to address them.</p>
    <hr>
    <h5>Step-by-Step</h5>
    <p>The last item I bought online was a memory foam mattress.
      I bought one because I just recently moved to San Jose from New York and needed something to sleep on.
     My process for buying this mattress included comparing products on Amazon by price, size, and rating. </p>
